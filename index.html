			<!-- your favorite animal's interesting fact goes here -->
			<p class="animal-highlight">Chows are powerful, compactly built dogs standing between 17 and 20 inches at the shoulder. Their several distinctive features include a lion’s-mane ruff around the head and shoulders; a blue-black tongue; deep-set almond eyes that add to a scowling, snobbish expression; and a “stilted” (stiff-legged) way of moving. </p>

			<p class="animal-detail">A powerful, sturdy, squarely built, upstanding dog of Arctic type, medium in size with strong muscular development and heavy bone. Clothed in a smooth or an offstanding rough double coat, the Chow is a masterpiece of beauty, dignity and naturalness.  Essential to true Chow type are his unique blue-black tongue, scowling expression and stilted gait. </p>
